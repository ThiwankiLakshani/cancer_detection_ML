# Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## Description

Welcome to the Cancer Detection using Deep Learning project! This tutorial aims to guide you through building a deep learning model for cancer detection using medical imaging data. Whether you're new to deep learning or an experienced practitioner, this tutorial will help you understand the process of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately detect cancerous cells or tumors from medical images such as mammograms or histopathology slides.

### Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Develop a CNN model using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to classify medical images as benign or malignant.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess medical images to enhance features and remove noise, ensuring optimal performance of the deep learning model.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the CNN model on labeled medical imaging datasets and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Web Interface (Optional)**: Build a web interface to upload medical images and get real-time predictions from the trained model.
- **Scalability**: Design the deep learning pipeline to handle large volumes of medical imaging data efficiently.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: A versatile programming language used for deep learning model development, data preprocessing, and web development.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: Popular deep learning frameworks used for building and training convolutional neural networks.
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library used for image preprocessing and augmentation.
- **Flask (Optional)**: A lightweight web application framework in Python used for building web interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS (Optional)**: For designing the user interface of the web application.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Cancer Detection using Deep Learning project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-detection.git
   cd cancer-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Preprocess Data (Optional)**:
   - If you're working with your own medical imaging dataset, preprocess the data using techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

4. **Train the Deep Learning Model**:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to open and run the notebook `train_model.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the preprocessed data, define the CNN model architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

5. **Start the Web Application (Optional)**:
   - If you've built a web interface for real-time predictions, start the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

6. **Access the Application (Optional)**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the cancer detection web interface.

### Folder Structure

- **/data**: Contains the medical imaging datasets used for training and testing the deep learning model.
- **/models**: Stores the trained deep learning model.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **/static** (Optional): Static files like CSS and JavaScript for the web interface.
- **/templates** (Optional): HTML templates for rendering web pages.
- **app.py** (Optional): Flask application file containing the routes and logic for the web interface.
